		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Hi, my name is Ryan Allarey and I am filipino! I am a junior studying computer science at the University of Delaware. I enjoy spending my time
			playing video games, listening to music, or making videos. I love learning about new technology and I've even built myself a new pc 
			recently. I am also heavily invested in the custom keyboard hobby. 
		</p>

			<strong>Interesting Fact: </strong>
			An interesting fact about me would be that I enjoy fashion and dressing up. I like to try out different styles and clothes to express myself! Street wear is a big favorite.
		</p>
			
		<h3>Web Development</h3>
		<p>
			I took this web applications to learn more about the process of web development and to be able to make my own websites. I am most interested in ...
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				learning more about html and css, especially being creative and stylistic with the websites we create.
			</li>
			<li>
				understanding APIs and what they do.
			</li>
			<li>
				learning more about security and how that affects web development.
