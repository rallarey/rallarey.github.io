	WHAT TO INCLUDE:
	This page should contain some content at your discretion that introduces you to me, your TA, and your classmates. 
	You might write something about yourself, or some other topic that interests you (e.g., movies, books, music, sports). Don't sweat this too much; 
	it is just some "content" to practice writing HTML and to help me, your TA, and your classmates get to know you better.
